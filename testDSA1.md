Perfect! I can see your code and terminal output clearly — great work!

Let me break down everything you're seeing here in your C++ code in a super clear and beginner-friendly way, including what's happening with memory and addresses.

---

### 🧠 Your Code (Line by Line)
```cpp
int ages[5] = {20, 12, 47, 45, 12};
```
- You're creating an array called `ages` that holds **5 integers**.
- These integers are stored in **contiguous memory** (next to each other).
- The values are:  
  ```
  Index:     0   1   2   3   4
  Value:    20  12  47  45  12
  ```

---

### 🖨️ This Line:
```cpp
std::cout << ages << std::endl;
```

- This **does not** print the contents of the array.
- It prints the **memory address** of the array — specifically, the address of the first element `&ages[0]`.
- Output:  
  ```
  0x7fff9d5f1b50
  ```
  This is the **base address** in hexadecimal.

---

### 📦 Then You Print:
```cpp
std::cout << ages[0] << std::endl;
std::cout << ages[3] << std::endl;
```

- This prints:
  ```
  20
  45
  ```
- Which are the values stored at index `0` and index `3`, just as expected.

### 📏 How the Memory is Structured

Let’s assume each `int` is 4 bytes (which is typical on most systems):

| Index | Value | Address (Hex)         | Address (Decimal)     |
|-------|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 0     | 20    | `0x7fff9d5f1b50`       | 140735926685392        |
| 1     | 12    | `0x7fff9d5f1b54`       | 140735926685396        |
| 2     | 47    | `0x7fff9d5f1b58`       | 140735926685400        |
| 3     | 45    | `0x7fff9d5f1b5c`       | 140735926685404        |
| 4     | 12    | `0x7fff9d5f1b60`       | 140735926685408        |

Notice how each index is **4 bytes apart**? That’s because each `int` takes 4 bytes.

### 🧪 Want to Explore More?

Here are some cool things you can try next in your program:

#### 1. 🔍 Print all addresses of each element:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    std::cout << "&ages[" << i << "] = " << &ages[i] << std::endl;
}
```

#### 2. 🧮 Do pointer arithmetic:
```cpp
int* ptr = ages;
std::cout << *(ptr + 3) << std::endl; // Will print 45
```

#### 3. 🎯 Print the address using a pointer:
```cpp
std::cout << ptr << std::endl;       // Same as ages
std::cout << ptr + 3 << std::endl;   // Address of ages[3]
```
